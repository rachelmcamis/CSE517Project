# CSE517Project
We reproduce experiments from the paper:
Chen, Yangyi, et al. "Textual Backdoor Attacks Can Be More Harmful via Two Simple
Tricks." EMNLP (2022).

The code that we use to reproduce comes from the StyleAttack github (https://github.com/thunlp/StyleAttack), which we have a copy of
in StyleAttack-main.

We run a combination of experiments that are in the paper and
are not in the paper above.

To run the experiments in the paper, run the python notebook "".

To run the experiments not in the paper, run the python notebook "NonPaperExperiments517FinalProject.ipynb".
